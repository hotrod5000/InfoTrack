Ideas for enhancements:

1. Provide the ability for the user to include paid ads in the search results
2. Show trends over time.  For example, if your URL of interest appears as #7 in the results today, is that an improvement over it's previous position?  Static snapshots aren't really telling much of a story, I want to know whether we're improving or not.
3. Because scraping sites leaves you at risk of being broken when the site changes the shape of it's data, it would be a good idea to have multiple implementations of your scraper that adhered to a common interface.
